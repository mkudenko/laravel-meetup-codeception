# Webscope Laravel

## After you clone the repo

### Install all the packages

    composer install
    npm install
    
### Create environment files

    cp .env.example .env
    
Specify the correct connection details in the new file.

### Create the database tables

    artisan migrate

_**Note:** Unit tests use SQLite database which runs in memory. It's already installed on the Webscope Vagrant box._
    
## Running tests

Setup Codeception.

    cp example.codeception.yml codeception.yml

Run the tests.

    vendor/bin/codecept run [unit|functional|acceptance]
    
Or, if you have codeception installed globally (you do on the Vagrant box), you can run

    codecept run [unit|functional|acceptance]
    
If you don't specify the test suite (unit, functional or acceptance), all of them will be executed.

Optionally, you can add the following line to your .bashrc file:

    alias t='vendor/bin/codecept run'
    
That way you can run you tests by running the following command from the root of the project:

    t [unit|functional|acceptance]
